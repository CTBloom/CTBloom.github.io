			Coffee is Art.  Brewing espresso requires careful handling and preparation of the beans.  If done correctly, the barista's canvas will be ready.  Then, they will delicately steam milk, their paint, and pour it onto the espresso and create their portrait.

			Coffee is Science.  Numerous variables go into brewing the perfect espresso, and they are interdependent, making the process of dialing in your espresso extremely time intensive and difficult.  The number of beans needs to be carefully weighed and adjusted, as does the grind size.  Not only that, but the length of time the shot pulls for is another variable.  Once an espresso is finally dialed in, the work isn't over.  The settings must be readjusted for each new roast that's fed into your machine.
